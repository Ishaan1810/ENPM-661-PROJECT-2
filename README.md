1)The code will ask for x and y coordinates of start and goal node individually.
3)Enter after each value the code will prompt to enter.
2)The only input it takes is int type.
3)The video that outputs the search and backtracking will be saved in the workspace( My Google colab ws in my case)



4)Libraries used:-
cv2:- writing and saving the video
numpy
timit:- to show the time taken to perform the search
Priorityqueue :- to access the specifically  required nodes 
matplotlip to show the plot of the map


the video file that has been uploaded has the following start and goal coordinates
Enter the X coordinate of the start node: 
10
Enter the Y coordinate of the start node: 
10
Enter the X coordinate of the Goal node: 
200
